# APIKeyLoader

Created shortly after leaking API keys on Github, adds in a single function. Function takes in a source .yaml file, a service, and a list of keys from that service to retrieve. Use example.yaml for context, but this is mainly used to prevent your API keys from needing to be hard coded, alleviating risk of account exposure and the headache that comes with that.
